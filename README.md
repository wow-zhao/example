# ESP32-CAM Project
## 1. Introduction
### environment
   esp-idf 4.4 + Vscode(espressif IDF) 
### hardware
   **board:**   Ai thinker esp32-cam  
   **camera:**  ov2640
### what this project can do?
   * using your PC or phone with browser(HTTP) to config the ESP32 wifi station mode.
   * using your PC or phone with browser(HTTP) to visit the camera.
   * using your PC or phone with browser(HTTP) to control the ESP32 (write by you).
### The workflow of this project is as follows  
   **a )** ESP32 reboot, open a wifi with softAP/station coexistence mode.  
   **b )** User uses PC or phone connect to AP open by ESP32. In this project, the AP ssid is "mywifissid", password is "123456789", which can be changed in WIFI_StaAp.c.  
   **c )** User uses browser to access 192.168.4.1/{command}, in which {command} can be "jpeg", "stream", "predict", "wifi".  
       *if you want to use command "predict", you should use command "wifi" to help ESP32 connect to a wifi first.*
    
 command  | query  | function | example
 -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- 
 wifi  | query1, query2 | help ESP32 connect to a wifi, whose ssid is query1, password is query2 | 192.168.4.1/wifi?query1=A&query2=123456
 jpeg  | none | get a capture.jpg | 192.168.4.1/jpeg
 stream  | none | get a video stream | 192.168.4.1/stream
 predict  | none | Upload current image(jpeg) to server url | 192.168.4.1/predict

## 2. How to use 
### same environment with me
   * download the Project first.
   * open a new project with sample_project template, copy all the files into the new project.
   * open ov2640.c and check the i/o #define.
   * build and flash the project.
### other environment
   * download the Project first.
   * help yourself.
### other tips
   * To use camera, you should tick the box of *"ESP32-specific -->  â–¡Support for external, SPI-connected RAM"* in the menuconfig, and *"Set RAM clock speed"* in 80MHz. Also change *"Serial flasher config --> Flash SPI speed"* into 80MHz.
   * The file "ov2640.c" and "ov2640.h" can not only use in ov2640 camera. These codes is changed from github/espressif/esp32-camera. If you want to use other camera, don't forget check the *"Camera configuration"* in menuconfig.
